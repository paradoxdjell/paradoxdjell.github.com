I [posted a while ago](http://saky.in/Net-Neutrality-in-India/) about why net neutrality is important, especially in a country like India.

![Net Neutrality Walkathon](http://saky.in/images/net-neutrality-walkathon.jpg "Taken from FSMK and I'm pretty sure they don't mind ;)")

[Free Software Movement Karnataka](http://fsmk.org/) organised a walkathon in Koramangala yesterday to protest and to spread awareness about the importance of net neutrality. Even with the heavy rainfall, the walkathon went well and we distributed quite a few of the handouts prepared.

I've embedded the images below!

Also, today is the last day to appeal TRAI to protect out internet. Hit up [savetheinternet.in](http://savetheinternet.in/) if you haven't already.
