Much has been said and written about the upcoming Apple Watch by people far greater and established in the world of technology. But as the date of its launch nears, I thought I'd put my two cents out there.

Apple is entering its first new device segment since the death of Steve Jobs and many have been wondering the past couple of years if Apple can actually do it anymore. And there have been more questions, ever since this article was published. Apple has always pushed for simplicity of use in their products and it remains to be seen how easy the Watch actually is to use.

Wearables are definitely the in thing right now, with the likes of Pebble, Samsung's Tizen, Android Wear and a variety of fitness trackers hitting the market. Pebble's first Kickstarter campaign was successfully funded in 2012. Samsung Galaxy Gear was released in 2013. Android Wear's first devices were released well over six months ago, in June, and they've mostly been popular with tech enthusiasts. And the Apple Watch will not be the only wearable solution on iOS. Pebble supports both iOS and Android and if rumours and Google's own track record are to be believed, Android Wear will soon support iOS. Of course none of these devices have truly made smartwatches absolutely indispensable. I love the convenience of a smartwatch but many people don't see the point in actually getting one.

And Apple fans will declare that the Apple Watch will solve that problem, simply because Apple has done it in the past. Apple was not the first company to make a tablet, but they were certainly the first to make a viable tablet. But, it must be remembered that the market was not as populated by strong competitors as the wearables market now is. Pebble has recently announced the Pebble Time and Time Steel, strong alternatives, especially for people who care about battery life. If Android Wear is made compatible with iOS, several outstanding watches such as the Asus ZenWatch, LG G Watch R, LG G Watch Urbane and the Huawei Watch will be compelling options.

And then there's the price. Apple products have often been priced higher than others in the market and in some ways, this has helped them attain a premium status. The cheapest Apple Watch will cost $349. Comparatively, the Asus ZenWatch, perhaps the best looking square smartwatch, can be bought for $199. Basically, Apple will be releasing a more expensive smartwatch into an already crowded marketplace. And they're perhaps the only company who can pull this off. People who can spend upto a $1000 for a phone can spring for the Apple Watch. It will be a hit, simply because of the brand value and awareness Apple has built. People will get ready to camp outside the Apple Store again.

No, I'm not against the Apple Watch. I welcome it, as more devices will lead to better ecosystems for wearables as a whole. And to those of you who came here expecting specifications or other technical details, I should tell you I care a lot more about the experience. And you can be sure that Apple will pack an amazing experience into the Apple Watch, even if it's not the easiest. Right now, I'm just waiting for the Apple event.

Edit: grammatical derps fixed.
