Switzerland has responded to ![Jony Ive's claims last year](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/03/ive-switzerland-trouble/), with Tag Heuer entering the smartwatch market with an Android Wear watch.

Tag Heuer is also teaming up with Intel to build the hardware of the watch. The company has also stated that the watch will retain Tag Heuer's signature style. This will be the first truly premium Android Wear watch, once it's released later this year.

Android Wear now has a great line-up of watches, starting at $199, going up to whatever the Tag Heuer watch will cost.
