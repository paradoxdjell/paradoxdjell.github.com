title: I Have A Beef With Hinduism
user: Aditya Saky
excerpt: I generally don't comment on non-tech happenings, especially where India's events are concerned. But this particular incident that has played out over the last few days is hard to ignore. A man called Mohammed Akhlaq was killed in Dadri, just 75km from Delhi, by a mob. No, not killed, but *lynched*. Why? A rumour was started that he consumed beef.

I generally don't comment on non-tech happenings, especially where India's events are concerned. But this particular incident that has played out over the last few days is hard to ignore. A man called Mohammed Akhlaq was killed in Dadri, just 75km from Delhi, by a mob. No, not killed, but *lynched*. Why? A rumour was started that he consumed beef.

Cows are regarded as sacred animals by Hindus, who make up the majority of the country's huge population. Thus, in most states, the slaughter of cows is illegal. However, posession and consumption of beef isn't illegal. We Indians seem to have forgotten that even many of our greatest sages frequently consumed cows.

How did it all start? A temple priest was pressured to announce that a calf had been killed. A mob set out and they attacked Mohammed Akhlaq and his son. They dragged the two out of their house and beat them with bricks. The mob even attacked Akhlaq's 82 years old mother, though not as seriously. Akhlaq's son is even now fighting for his life in a hospital.

There is something seriously wrong when humans can kill other humans much more easily than a cow. What's more worrying is that many people were wondering if it was actually a cow that was killed or a goat (the meat was found to be goat meat). Does it make a difference? A man was killed! His son is fighting for his life! Are you telling me that if the meat was that of a cow, the killing was right?

Social media is filled with people condemning the writers who have reported the incident and others who are busy dredging up riots carried out by Muslims like that's a justification. Some comments border on the ridiculous. On a post written by The Times of India, I came across "shit eating hindu is better than beef eating hindu" and other ridiculous comments. This brings to the fore how narrow minded people actually are. The anonymous nature of some message boards has allowed several people to ask what Akhlaq's punishment for eating beef is. It has also allowed people to declare that the rights of cows is more important than the rights of people who eat cows.

The country is currently ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a Hindu Nationist party. Within hours of this gruesome incident, several BJP members got busy defending the mob. One minister decided that the slaughter of a cow is an extenuating circumstance. Another called for the dismissal of the FIR filed against members of the mob.

We're now 15 years into the 21st century but the extremism is only becoming more pronounced. This particular incident is definitely not the worst or the bloodiest tragedy brought about by religion, but it is just as bad. If somebody can lose their life on the basis of a rumour, that too a rather trivial rumour in the grand scale of things, we have a very big problem. We need to get our priorites straight. I'm technically a Hindu, the son of an Iyer. And I have a beef with Hinduism.
