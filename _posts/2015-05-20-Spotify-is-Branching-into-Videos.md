excerpt: I was a user of Spotify till a month ago and I was generally a fan of the service. I made the switch to Rdio last month simply because Rdio is cheaper, even though the Spotify app is quite a lot better.

As a service, Spotify, Rdio and the rest aren't really different. All of them provide unlimited music streaming for a fixed price. Some of them also have free streaming services with advertisements. That is, until today. Spotify is no longer just a music service. Spotify will now offer podcasts and videos. They've teamed up with content providers and while the list isn't very long, it's quite impressive, with prominent names such as BBC, Comedy Central, ESPN, MTV and TED.

This announcement comes at the right time and signifies a major evolution for the company. With new services like Tidal stealing the spotlight, Spotify is proving it can adapt to the changing environment.
