Hi! I'm Aditya Saky.

I'm an amateur web designer, based in Bangalore, India. I'm also studying Computer Science. I'm also one of the developers behind [VentureROM](http://venturerom.com), a custom ROM for Android.

I'm also the co-creator/owner (can chat-rooms be owned?) of the chat-room shield on Scrollback. This is a chat-room for all things S.H.I.E.L.D. from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I've embedded the chat-room on this site. Join the discussion, if you're an Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. or Agent Carter fan!
